## Setup

- A phone, tablet or laptop to run the game.
- Everyone sits around the table.
- If there are 6 or more players, consider splitting them into 2 teams, with roughly equal number of players.

## Roles

{{ GAME_NAME }} is a cooperative game party game. In one round, one player in the team is designated as the clue giver, and the other players in the team are the guessers.

If you're players as 2 teams, all players in the other team will observe and also try to guess after the first team has made their guess.

## Spectrum card

If you're the clue giver, turn the device to face yourself so no one else can see what is on the screen.

The game randomly shows you a spectrum card, which generally consists of a pair of words that have opposite meaning.

If you're not happy with the spectrum card, feel free to click **Next** to generate a new one.

## Markers

The game also shows you a random position of markers, which are labelled as 2, 3, 4, 3, and 2 on the slider. The slider can't be moved yet.

Your goal is to give a clue, either a word or a phrase, that best describe the position of the markers, especially the number 4 marker, in relative to the spectrum. The clue should not contain any number or quantitative word that can be easily deduced.

Click **Start** to hide the labels, and turn the device for everyone to see the spectrum.

## Guessers

The rest of the team try to deduce the position of the markers based on the given clue. Everyone is free to discuss and adjust the slider, but the final decision should be based on majority or given to the person to the left of the clue giver.

Once everyone agrees, click **Reveal** to show the markers.

## Scoring

If the slider lands on the number 4 marker, congratulations! Your team makes the perfect guess. Otherwise, 3 or 2 are okay too. If the guess is total off from the markers, that's too bad.

## Next Round

The player to the left of the clue giver becomes the new clue giver. The game continues until every one has the same number of turns as a clue giver.

If you play as 2 team, alternative between the teams.
