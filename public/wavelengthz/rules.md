## Setup

- A phone, tablet or laptop to run the game.
- Everyone sits around the table.
- If there are 6 or more players, consider splitting them into 2 teams, with roughly equal number of players.

## Roles

{{ GAME_NAME }} is a cooperative game party game. In one round, one player in the team is designated as the clue giver, and the other players in the team are the guessers.

If you're players as 2 teams, all players in the other team will observe and also try to guess after the first team has made their guess.

## Spectrum card and random position

The clue giver turns the device to face themselves so no one else can see what is on the screen.

The game randomly shows you a spectrum card, which generally consists of a pair of words that have opposite meaning.

The game also shows you a random position of markers, which are labelled as 2, 3, 4, 3, and 2 on the slider. The slider can't be moved yet.

If the clue giver is not happy with the spectrum card, feel free to click **Next** to generate a new one. Otherwise, the clue giver tries to come up with a word or a phrase that best describe the position of the markers in relative to the spectrum.
