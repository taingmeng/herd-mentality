# OBJECT OF THE GAME

**{{ GAME_NAME }}** is a social deduction game.

Each player takes turn to draw only 1 stroke on the paper
using different color pens, crayons, or markers.
Continue for 2 rounds until everyone has drawn 2 strokes.

Discuss and analyse the drawing.

Count down 3, 2, 1 and vote for the fake artist by pointing to
who you believe is the fake artist simultaneously.


If there is no clear majority pointing to fake artist (not
pointed to the most or has received the same number of votes
as other artists), the fake artist win.


If the fake artist is caught, they have one chance to guess
the actual word. If the fake artist&apos;s answer is correct,
the fake artist wins. Otherwise, other players win.
