## Setup

- A phone, tablet or laptop to run the game.
- Everyone sits around the table.

## Game Play

Take turns to move marbles on the game board one at a time to organize the marbles by color.

The marbles are clustered when all marbles of a color are orthogonally adjacent to each other.

The placement of each color cluster is free â€“ as long as all marbles of a certain color are adjacent to each other.

Do bear in mind that you are not allowed to communicate your plans or to indicate unambiguously what you want someone else to do. In effect, you may not speak at all during the game.

The player who last remained silent while listening to someone else may start.

## Turn Sequence & Game End

On your turn, pick any marble on the board and put it on the empty spot (there is always one empty spot on the board).

The next player clockwise takes their turn and moves any marble to the empty spot. The scorekeeper records another turn on the pad. The scorekeeper must remember to record all turns played.

You are allowed to move any marble until the end of the game.

The game ends immediately when all marbles are organized in clusters by color.

## Scoring Rules

Scoring is based on the shapes of the color clusters on the board, the position of the empty spot, and the number of turns played.

The players are allowed to talk when scoring, but with hushed tones.

Each different shape of the color clusters:
5 points each.

The middle spot is empty:
5 points.

The total score is the number of turns played subtracted from the sum of the cluster shape points and the middle spot points.

If the final score is one or more, congratulations are in order: you have won!
