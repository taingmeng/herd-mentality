## Setup

- A phone, tablet or laptop to run the game.
- Everyone sits around the table.

## Master, Insider and Commons

Once you enter everyone's name and proceed, the game randomly assigns everyone a role. There will be 1 master, 1 insider, and multiple commons. Pass the device around so that everyone can see their role secretly.

The player whose role is master must declare themselves as the master. The game also reveal the first player after the randomization is the master.

The player whose role is insider do not reveal anything, i.e. pretend to be one of the commons.

## 5 minutes to ask questions

The commons and the insider then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master "yes" or "no"-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The master can only answer "Yes", "No" or "I don't know". There is no turn order in asking questions. Some players may ask more questions than the others. 

The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word, without asking too obvious questions.

The phase ends when a player asks the correct question Is it X thing? Remember who asked the final question. The insider may also attempt the ask the correct question.

If no one asked the correct question, everyone loses. Otherwise, proceed to the end game discussion and voting.

## Discuss

If a player asked the question correctly, start a one minute timer on your device.

Everyone, including the master, can openly discuss who is the insider by reviewing the questions that were asked in the previous phase. You may end the discussion sooner or later than one time, but try not drag it for too long.

## First round of voting: is the guesser the insider?

To vote, everyone except the guess put their fist on the table. On the count of 3, everyone shows a thumb up if they think the guesser is a the insider. You can also choose whatever voting method you prefer. The guesser reveal their identity.

- If there is no majority or the majority are wrong, the insider wins.
- If the guesser is the insider, and the majority vote for the insider, the master and the commons win.
- If the guesser is a common, and the majority vote for the common, proceed to the next voting.


## Second round of voting: who is to the insider?

To vote, on the count of 3, all players, including the guesser, point at the same time to who they think is the insider.

If there is a tie between two or more players, the guesser's vote is counted as 2.

If the majority votes for the insider, the master and the common wins. Otherwise, the insider wins.
