## Setup

- A phone, tablet or laptop to run the game.
- A number of erasable markers equal to the number of players.
- 15 erasable cards, which have a smooth surface on both sides.
- Write down the following categories on one side of the card:
  1. Animals and Nature
  1. Brands and Companies
  1. Careers
  1. Famous People
  1. Fictional Characters
  1. Food and Drink
  1. Historical Figures
  1. Items and Objects
  1. Literature and Theatre
  1. Movies
  1. Places and Locations
  1. Recreations
  1. Songs
  1. Tech and Inventions
  1. Television
- Arrange the category cards in a 3x5 grid or a 5x3 grid at the center of the table.
- Everyone sits around the table and make sure the category cards are within reach for everyone.
- Alternatively, if you don't have markers and cards, use normal papers or sticky notes in place of the cards, and use any drawing app or Notes on your phone to write.

## One guesser, the rest are clue givers

{{ GAME_NAME }} is a cooperative game party game. In one round, one player is designated as the guesser, and the other players are the clue givers.

## Generate a card

The game randomly shows you a card, which consists of a category and a word or compound words. If you don't like the card, click "<b>Next</b>" to generate a new one. The card must be kept hidden from the guesser and shown to the clue givers, so place your device where the guess couldn't see the screen.

One clue giver, preferably the person to the left of the guesser, pick up the category card on the table matching the category shown on the device, show it to the guesser, and put it aside. This category can't be used by the clue givers.

## Writing clue

The guesser says "{{ GAME_NAME }}!" to signal the start of the round! Simultaneously, each clue giver quickly picks up one category card (please don't fight if someone is trying to pick the same category as you) and write down their clue at the back of the card. Once you finish writing down your clue, keep the clue face down, and wait for everyone else to finish.

## Guess the word

The guesser picks one clue giver to reveal the clue. If the guesser guesses incorrectly, the guesser picks another clue giver to reveal the clue. This continues until the guesser guesses the word(s) correctly. The clue giver of that clue and the guesser each gets 1 point.

## Guess the clues

For each of the remaining unrevealed clues, the guesser guesses what clue was written down. If the guesser guess correctly, the clue giver of that clue and the guesser each gets 1 point.

For example, in a game with 5 players, if all the guesses are correct, the guesser could get 4 points, while each of the clue giver could get 1 point each.

Scoring is optional though.

## New round

Erase the clues and put the category cards back to their original position, including the category card that was set aside.

In the new round, generate a new card, and the guesser role is rotated clockwise. The person to the left of the previous guesser is the new guesser. The game continues until each player has taken the role of guesser 2 times.
