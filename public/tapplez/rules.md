## Generate a category

## Say a word in the category

If a player is not able to come up with a word within 10 seconds, that player is eliminated. The round continues until there is only one remaining player left.

## Pause the timer if needed

If there is any debate on the word, press the timer to pause. Once that is resolved, press the timer again to resume.

## If all alphabets are used

If all the alphabets are used up, and there are still more than 1 remaining player, all the alphabets are reset. The remaining players must use 2 alphabets (say a word for each alphabet) within 10 seconds.

In the rare case where there are still more than 1 remaining player, all the alphabets are reset. The remaining players must use 3 alphabets (say a word for each alphabet) within 10 seconds.
