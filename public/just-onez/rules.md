# OBJECT OF THE GAME

**{{ GAME_NAME }}** is a cooperative party game.
You all play together to get the best score!

Together, make one of the players – the active player– guess a Mystery word by secretly writing a clue on your paper.

Choose your clue without coordinating with each other and be original so as not to write the same clue as another player, as all identical clues will be canceled before the active player gets to see them.

At the end of the game, tally your score based on the number of Mystery words found. 

# SETUP

1. Randomly choose a player to be the first active player. 

1. Place a phone or tablet where everyone except the active player can see the Mystery word. Ideally, place the device in front of the active player and facing the other players.

1. Give everyone a piece of paper and a pen.

Note: a small white boards and erasable markers would be better. If not, everyone can use any note app on their phone to write down their clue.

# GAME OVERVIEW

The game plays out in a succession of turns and ends when the deck of cards is empty.
Each turn is divided into 4 phases.

## 1. CHOOSE THE MYSTERY WORD

The player sitting on the left or right of the active player presses the **Next** button to load a new Myster word.

**Note**: If any other player doesn’t know the chosen word, simply press **Next** again to load a new Myster word.

## 2. CLUE SELECTION

Without communicating with each other and without showing it to anyone, each player writes one clue on their paper. That clue must be composed of a single word. Note: a digit, a number, an acronym, an onomatopoeia, or a special character are all considered to be words and hence invalid.

Example: 007 is allowed to help someone guess Bond, just like Riiiiiinnng or SMS are allowed to help someone guess Telephone, and $ is allowed to help someone guess America.

### Invalid clues:
• The Mystery word but written differently.
Example: Shurt is not allowed when trying to make the player guess Shirt.

• The Mystery word written in a foreign language.
Example: Buisson is not allowed if the word to be guessed is Shrub.

• A word from the same family as the Mystery word.
Example: Princess is not allowed if the word to be guessed is Prince.

• An invented word.
Example: Swee’ting is not allowed to try to help someone guess Cake.

• A word phonetically identical to the Mystery word, but the meaning of which is different.
Example: Whether is not allowed to try to get someone to guess Weather.

## 3. COMPARING CLUES

Once all players have written their clues, the active player closes their eyes.

During this time, the other players show their paper around and compare their clue with the other players. All identical or invalid clues are cancelled. To cancel a clue, simply flip the paper over to hide the clue.

### Identical clues:
• Two identical words.
Example: Mouse and Mouse are identical.

• Variants from the same word family.
Example: Prince and Princess are considered to be identical.

• Variants of the same word: plurals, gender differentiations, and spelling mistakes don’t count as actual differences.
Example: Prince and Princes, Actor and Actress, Philosophy and Filosofie are identical.

Note: If all clues have been cancelled, move directly to the End of turn phase. 

## 4. GUESS

Once the identical or invalid clues have been cancelled, ask the active player to open their eyes and try to guess the Mystery word with the help of the remaining clues. To do this, they’re allowed ONLY ONE GUESS.

### Scoring
If you want to add some competetiveness into the game, follow this suggested scoring rule:
* If the active player guesses the Mystery word correctly, the active player get 1 point.
* The players with the clues shown to the active player also get 1 point each.
* The players with identical clues do not get any point.
* The game ends when any player reaches 10 points.

Otherwise, like many party games, you don't have to keep track of any score. Just continue to play and have fun.

# END OF TURN
The player to the left of the active player becomes the new active player. A new turn begins.

# VARIANT FOR 3 PLAYERS
With 3 players, the game plays out according to the standard rules as previous stated, with the exception of the following change:

During setup, players each take two pieces of paper. During the choice of clues, they write one clue on each of their paper. Each player therefore provides 2 clues instead of a single one. Identical clues are also cancelled during the Comparison Phase of clue selection.
